Comments: Home price could influence loan risk either way, depending on whether
the home is paid off or not. It looks like you have this information in the 
data, so should be interesting to see if it is used, or if you need to further
add a column that captures whether the worth of the home is a positive or negative
factor. Not sure how useful the heatmap visualization is generally ... Overall, 
this seems like good data to use for classification.
